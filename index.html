        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>A scientist turned developer.</p>
        <p>Originally, I began my career with a Bachelors in Geology working in the oil field 
            of the Permian Basin (West Texas - for those non-Geology folks).  Life took me in 
            a different direction and I landed in an position working in IT in Eastern Iowa for 
            John Deere where I <span>developed</span> (pun totally intended) a passion for 
            programming. After a very intense program with General Assembly, I am now a full-stacked 
            web-developer.</p>
            <p>Along the way, I managed to turn two of my other passions, yoga and salsa-dancing, 
            into side-hustles and I teach both weekly to beginners and intermediate/advanced 
            students - although my preferred niche is beginners because I enjoy making people 
            feel comfortable with a new skill.</p>
            <p>I married into my final side-hustle and became co-owner of my husband's sound and 
            lighting company, J&amp;E Entertainment.  On most weekends we can be found DJing 
            weddings, graduation parties, birthday parties, you name it.</p>
